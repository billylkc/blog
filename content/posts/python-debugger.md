## Introduction {#introduction}

The only way to be a zero bug programmer is to ****not write any code****.

All jokes aside, tooling plays an important roles in debugging. Iâ€™ve seen many practitioners try to spot bugs using only print statements instead of actual debugging tools. Sometimes it is a personal preference, but sometimes you just do not know it exists.

This post is a gentle introduction of the debugging tools `pdb` and `debugging mode` in Visual Studio Code. Hopefully you will have a better understanding on what functionalities a good debugger offers.


## Functionalities {#functionalities}


## pdb {#pdb}

The Python debugger `pdb` implements an ****interactive debugging environment**** that you can use with any of your programs written in Python.

With features that let you pause your program, look at what values your variables are set to, and go through program execution in a discrete step-by-step manner, you can more fully understand what your program is doing and find bugs that exist in the logic or troubleshoot known issues.

## Final thoughts {#final-thoughts}

By now you should have a basic understanding of how debugging works in Python, as well as the tools available in pdb in standard library, to graphical debugging in IDE like visual studio code. Using a debugger for your own codebases is really going to supercharge your productivity.

Happy Coding!
