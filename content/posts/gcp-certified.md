## Finally {#finally}

I told myself two years ago I want to get both of these certs. Finally did it.

It definitely helps me a lot when designing an end-to-end data science solution.

    Finally got my architect certificate in the second try! I am super excited about this!

    It probably doesn't mean much. But I am still pretty excited to be qualified in the Code Jam 2021 First round. It's fun to pick up algorithm again once in a while.
